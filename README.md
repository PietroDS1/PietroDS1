## Summary
Hello, my name is Pietro and yes, my favorite number is 3.14. I have always had a desire to help others, 
and that led me to pursue a career in technology, which I believe is the best part of me. Video games 
have played a significant role in my life, and as I grew older, my passion for them has only grown 
stronger. They helped me overcome depression and find happiness. This personal background has 
fueled my ambition to improve the lives of people who have experienced similar challenges, which is 
why I became a programmer. Today, I can proudly say that the products and applications I develop have 
the potential to fulfill my dream of transforming lives.
